# Efficient-Frontier-
Modern Portfolio Theory is a theory about how investors (who are risk averse) construct portfolios that maximise their expected returns for given levels of risk. The breakthrough insight from MPT was the fact that risks and returns characteristics of various investments need not be isolated and analysed but looked at how these investments affected the performance of a portfolio. Efficient Frontier: offers the maximum expected returns for a given level of risk.
